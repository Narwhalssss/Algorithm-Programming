# Reversi documentation
My project is a reversi game made in python using pygame. Reversi or Othello is a strategy board game. The game is played on an 8x8 board with pieces that have a black and white side. The game's goal is to have the majority of the pieces on the board be your colour by the end of the game. The game are you against a computer instead of other people.

## Reflection
In this project, I learned that I still have lots to learn there are a lot of python codes that are new to me during the making of this project. And planning to improve in the future
Also, I need to be better at managing my time and I need to fix myself because I procrastinated most of the time during this project.
I need to increase my creativity, in this project I followed a guide on how to make a reversi game in python.
I still can't come up with codes myself.
I am now I’m lacking on knowledge of coding, after this project I’ll more serious about learning to code
